# welcome
I am a Knowledge Engineer and Psychomotor Skill acquisition expert. My work focuses on using relational algebras and graph structures to engineer data-driven information service architectures. 

The peculiarities and inconveniences of set transformation (e.g. $f: X \to Y$) have fascinated me since early childhood. Particular interests include data visualization, composable information architectures, and graph structures. Perhaps most engaging, personally, is inference based on the difference in information localization (change in entropy) between $n$-adjacent states in a time series process.

My employer, <a href="https://www.relational.ai/" target="_blank">RelationalAI</a>, is pioneering the use of "Graph Normal Form" (6NF) and relational algebras for data storage and computation over stored data. At SimPORTAL (University of Minnesota Medical School), I pioneered the use of causal modeling (see <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html" target="_blank">Judea Pearl</a>) for Psychomotor Skill evaluation. My CV has more, [take a look][cv].

Personally, I train martial arts and Kettlebell Sport, and serve the whims of two cats. More in [About][about].
