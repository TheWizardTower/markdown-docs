# welcome
Jason A. Grafft is a Knowledge Engineer and Psychomotor Skill acquisition expert using applied information theory to solve complex problems. His work focuses on applying relational algebras to graph structures and finite sets to engineer data-driven information service architectures for use in modern statstical analyses at scale.

The peculiarities and inconveniences of temporally-bounded set interactions have fascinated Jason since early childhood. Inference based on time-ordered changes to information locality expressed as differences&mdash;&Delta; ("Delta(s)") by convention&mdash;between two information states ordered in time is a strong interest.

Jason's current employer, RelationalAI, is pioneering the use of "Graph Normal Form" (6NF) and relational algebras for data storage and computation over stored data. At SimPORTAL (University of Minnesota Medical School), Jason pioneered the use of causal inference for Psychomotor Skill evaluation. See more in his CV.

Personally, Jason actively trains martial arts and serves the whims of two cats. See more in About.
