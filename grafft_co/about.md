## *Integrity is not certainty*
A clinical mentor of mine gave me a small gift when I graduated from [Northwestern Health Sciences University](https://www.nwhealth.edu/); I wanted to do the same for my Data Science students.

[Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) demonstrates the need to reason about data via many transformation functions ("views"). The phrase *Integrity is not certainty* is my way of suggesting this is a necessary and responsible effort.

**IMAGE OF long2quan2 SEAL IMPRINT, CHOP(?)**

This was given to me (and financed by my parents, I believe) by my gongfu instructor, Steve Collins, when he promoted me to instructor in our gongfu system **CHARACTERS** (*long2quan2*, lit. "dragon fist").

The artist, Mr. Henry Li of [Blue Heron Arts](https://www.blueheronarts.com/), had to invent a rendering for **CHARACTERS** (*quan2*, lit. "fist") because it is, alomst literally, too vulgar a character to be represented in seal script. Mr. Li tells the story much better than I, *and* you can watch him etch the chop!

## Me
### Combat Sports
I have trained martial arts for over 30 years, and still train actively though "retired" from competition. Striking and clinch work are my preference—Glory/K-1, Muay Thai, Sanshou, Boxing, Krav Maga—though I train and very much respect grappling. My home gym is [Spartan Martial Arts](https://spartanmartialartsgym.com/).
