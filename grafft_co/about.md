[Anscombe's Quartet][quartet] demonstrates the need to reason about data via many transformation functions ("views"). The phrase *Integrity is not certainty* suggests this is a necessary and responsible effort.

## Favicon/Web Avatar
Given by his gongfu instructor, Steve Collins, (and financed by his parents) when Jason was promoted to instructor in **CHARACTERS** (*long2quan2gong3fu3*, lit. "dragon fist gong fu").

The artist, Mr. Henry Li of [Blue Heron Arts][bha], had to invent a rendering for **CHARACTERS** (*quan2*, lit. "fist") because it is, alomst literally, too vulgar to be represented in canonized seal script. Hear the story and watch him carve the seal!
