## Combat Sports
Jason has practiced martial arts for over 30 years, a majority full-contact.

His home gym is <a href="https://spartanmartialartsgym.com/" target="_blank">Spartan Martial Arts</a>.

The artist, Mr. Henry Li of <a href="https://www.blueheronarts.com/" target="_blank">Blue Heron Arts</a>, had to invent a rendering for **CHARACTERS** (*quan2*, lit. "fist") because it is, alomst literally, too vulgar to be represented in canonized seal script. Hear the story and watch him carve the seal!

## *Integrity is not certainty*
A clinical mentor, Chris Hafner, gifted a small item when Jason graduated from Northwestern Health Sciences University and he wanted to do the same for his students.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet" target="_blank">Anscombe's Quartet</a> demonstrates the need to reason about data via many transformation functions ("views"). The phrase *Integrity is not certainty* suggests this is a necessary and responsible effort.
