# (Toward) Artificial Intelligence with Relational Machine Learning
Relational Machine Learning (rML) models are structure preserving, enabling their algorithms to reason about the nodes (data entites) _and_ edges (entity relations) in a dataset. Aritifical Intelligence (AI) applications are principally concerned with making sufficiently accurate inference in response to "new" (to the model) data _ad hoc_. Representing data as a graph and "new" information as an update to that graph, we can think of ML models as descriptions of how the relations (edges) between data entities (nodes) mutate in response to new informaiton, and AI models as logical rules for interpreting a piece of information "in light of" (change?---is meaning clear?) a reference graph.

Relational ML (rML) models "begin life" (change) with edges in place.
