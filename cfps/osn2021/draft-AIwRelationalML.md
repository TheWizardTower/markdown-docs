# (Toward) Artificial Intelligence with Relational Machine Learning
Relational Machine Learning (rML) models are structure preserving, enabling their algorithms to reason about the nodes (data entites) _and_ edges (entity relations) in a dataset. Aritifical Intelligence (AI) applications are principally concerned with making sufficiently accurate inferences in response to "new" (to the model) data _ad hoc_. Thinking of data as a graph and "new" information as an update to that graph, we can think of ML models as descriptions of how the relations (edges) between data entities (nodes) mutate in response to new informaiton, and AI models as logical rules for interpreting new information in light of the existing graph.

We'll review an example ML-AI pipeline. We will start with how existing relations in data may be integrated into an ML model, then look at how the model integrates new information, then examine how the AI layer responds to requests for inference. By the end, you'll see the benefits rML models can provide and have an understanding of how new and existing models can leverage relational intelligence.
