# (Toward) Artificial Intelligence with Relational Machine Learning
Relational Machine Learning (rML) models are structure preserving, enabling their algorithms to reason about the nodes (data entites) _and_ edges (entity relations) in a dataset. Aritifical Intelligence (AI) applications are principally concerned with making sufficiently accurate inference in response to "new" (to the model) data _ad hoc_. Representing data as a graph and "new" information as an update to that graph, we may reason about ML models as the set of edges which relate entities in a data graph.
