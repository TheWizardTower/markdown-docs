# (Toward) Artificial Intelligence with Relational Machine Learning
Relational Machine Learning (rML) models are structure preserving, enabling their algorithms to reason about the nodes (data entites) _and_ edges (entity relations) in a dataset. *(rough transition)* Aritifical Intelligence (AI) applications are principally concerned with making sufficiently accurate inference in response to "new" (to the model) data _ad hoc_. Most often, AI seeks to replicate the reasoning of biologic entities, which readily synthesizes sparse and often tenuosly-connected data into paradoxical predictive accuracy. *(reword)* Mathematically, these reasoninig processes may be modeled via the composition of relations between data (edges)
